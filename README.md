If you are building locally, place the files here:

```
..\core-firmware\inc\Stepper.h
..\core-firmware\src\application.cpp (renamed from Spark-Stepper.cpp)
..\core-firmware\src\Stepper.cpp
..\core-firmware\src\build.mk (optional, if you have your own make file going, just add the Stepper.cpp to it)
```
